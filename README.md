Description:

This UI automation projects goes through testing end to end scenarios for the E-commerce Fresh website and the Flutter Web app. I have created a maven project and implemented the automation using Selemium WebDriver. I am also using cucumber and Gerkin to implement BDD scenarios.

Running the project locally:

Please install cucumber and Gerkin plug-ins to your editor After the project builds and all remaining dependencies are available in the pom.xml file.
You can run the runner class : EcommerceFreshMain.java

Reporting:
Reporting is available in both formats JSON and html format. screenshots are added at the end of each run

Areas to improve:
Due to lack of time I would recommend additional refactoring can be done to the project and negative scenarios can be added also.
